{"text": "\"\n\n List of Freemasons \n\nCalling John Alexander Cuza's name \"\"defamation\"\" is overreactive hyperbole.  Both names appear in the lead of his article, and if \"\"invented names\"\" are defamation, then millions upon millions of people are \"\"defaming\"\" Jesus Christ by calling him such! He's really \"\"Yehoshua\"\" in Aramaic, not \"\"Iesu\"\" in Greek, or \"\"Jesus\"\" in English or Spanish.  Now, I don't think you would be able to make that case.  \n\nLet's see...Charlemagne is \"\"Carolus Magnus\"\", \"\"Karolus Magnus\"\" or \"\"Charles the Great,\"\" George III of the United Kingdom is \"\"King George III\"\" (birth name  \"\"George William Frederick\"\").  In short, trying to claim that there aren't different names for people in different languages or areas is one of the biggest cases of tilting at windmills since Don Quixote (Sorry, I meant El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha).\n\nAdditionally, you are also claiming, in essence, that any wiki not in the native language of the subject is defamatory of the subject by its very existence because it's an \"\"invented name\"\".  For example, George Washington is ja:ジョージ・ワシントン,(\"\"Jouji Washinton\"\").  So you claim an entire language group is defamatory because their alphabet is different?  Really?\n\nNow, everything else aside, what I think this really is is some sort of Romanian ultra-nationalism on your part, and that's not appropriate either.  I say \"\"ultra\"\" because you're having a fit over not content, but the spelling of a name calling it \"\"defamatory\"\" and \"\"invented\"\".  That's very overreactionary, and if you don't like the connotations of the label, don't engage in behavior that will label you as such.\n\nThis is English Wikipedia, and as such, the enwiki MOS and naming policies are what will be followed, and the article title is what we will link to because that is the policy.

The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.", "label": "toxic"}

{"text": "\"\n\nThe trouble with Mahler analysis is that there isn't a consensus about his compositional thinking.   So, like it or not, comments are going to be subjective, and may well look like \"\"original research\"\".    But it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony (he deliberately withheld a number from it, because he had a superstition about Ninth Symphonies being terminal: the work we know as his Ninth was in fact his Tenth, and, like Das Lied von der Erde, posthumously premiered).   This article doesn't address that.   It has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four - movements 3 -5 jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale.  (One also quotes the Eighth Symphony's second movement).  It might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria (two of each, separated by a funeral march, based on elements of the Trinklied which begins the work, in the role of a development section) and sonata.  The last section of the finale with its repeated \"\"Ewig\"\", could also be seen  both as  a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception.   So the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed.  But we still have something which can be called a symphony, even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor, the Eighth, could be imagined.   I'm not proposing this as an addition to the article, simply suggesting that it wouldn't be too hard to find similar thinking in the literature.94.192.68.44    Croy379\"", "label": "nontoxic"}

{"text": "\"\nno seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that \"\"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot\"\".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says \"\"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY\"\" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.\n\nIf you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said \"\"What language is that?\"\" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.\n\nYour other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between \"\"nigga\"\" and \"\"nigger\"\", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word \"\"nigger\"\".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.\n\nI forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to \"\"Winston Churchill\"\".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.
